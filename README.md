# Package1

The goal of Package1 is to provide users with a simple, trivial function that will add up two numbers.

## Example

This is a basic example:

Suppose you want to add up 2,995,674 and 547,229.  This package will allow you to input those two numbers into an R function called `trivialsum`, which will sum the numbers you input, and display the resulting sum of the numbers.

```r
## basic example code
trivialsum(2995674, 547229)
#> Error in trivialsum(2995674, 547229): could not find function "trivialsum"
```
